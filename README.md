# Spoofax plugin for Netbeans

## Testing

1. Add the _Spoofax Netbeans Update Center_ in Tools/Plugins, tab
   Settings. Use the URL
   https://raw.github.com/hendrikvanantwerpen/spoofax-netbeans/update-center/updates.xml

2. After the update center is installed, go to the list of available
   plugins and install _Spoofax_.

3. Set the path to your languages in Tools/Options, tab
   Spoofax. Language paths can be either directories or archives.

4. Open a project using languages that are in your path and enjoy
   syntax errors and highlighting.

NB. If you add languages to your path after a project is opened, you
may have to restart Netbeans before it recognizes the files as Spoofax
files.
